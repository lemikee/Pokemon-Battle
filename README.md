# Pokemon-Battle

## Background
Pokemon Battle! is a recreation of the one-on-one Pokemon battling functionality that is a staple of modern Pokemon games. It allows trainers to battle their respective Pokemon, using their knowledge of type weaknesses, items, and battling mechanics to triumph (or run) over their opponents. <br>

The classic Pokemon battling functionality pits two trainers against each other, where they are able to select a Pokemon to battle, when to use items, and when to switch Pokemon in addition to choosing one of four possible attacks for each Pokemon. This clone will retain the battling (attack) functionality but will forgo the ability to switch Pokemon. Instead, the player will be able to battle using on of the three original starter Pokemon. <br>

• Choose an attack to use on the opposing Pokemon <br>
